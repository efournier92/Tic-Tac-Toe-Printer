#Tic Tac Toe Printer

Here's a Ruby app I wrote to print the contents of a tic tac toe game to the CLI.

The top section in `app.rb` contains a quick and dirty method for printing a game board.

The latter part of my code has a method with a more stylish approach to printing the board, using ASCII art.

###Usage

* Call `print_simple` to output unstyled game board
* Call `print_stylish` to output ASCII art game board.
* Both of the above methods take a single array argument, containing the game outcome.

###Sample Output
